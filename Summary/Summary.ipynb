    "Given the dataset, we first clean the text data and change it into vectors, and extract features after building our own sentiment dictionary, then we try models such as linear regression, multinomial logistic regression, XGboost etc, in order to figure out what makes a review positive or negative and predict stars in the test dataset.

    "It is easy for human to understand whether a review is positive or negative through reading the text. However, when facing a large set of reviews, we need machines to do this for us. Therefore, the goal is to build models and then teach machine to do predictions of ratings as accurate as possible."

    "All the reviews firstly are splitted into single words and then stored in the new dataset, while all the others like punctuations, whitespace and special symbols are removed. \n",
    "## 3.2 Transform to lower case\n",
    "Secondly, we change all the upper case in all of the words into lower case in order to treat them the same and count their frequency of use.\n",
    "## 3.3 Word stemming and lemmatization\n",
    "Thirdly, in order to recognize the same words which appear as different forms, we do word stemming and lemmatization. For example, 'playing' and 'played' are changed into the same as their shared root 'play'.\n",

    "Firstly, by using R package 'text2vec', we count how many words are used in the whole training dataset and then treat each of them as a variable. For each cleaned review, the value becomes 0 if it does not cotain this word, otherwise the value is its count of use in this review. After every words in every review is assigned a value, we obtain a sparse matrix. The number of columns equals the number of words in total and the number of rows is the number of reviews.\n",
    "## 4.2 TF-IDF\n",
    "TF-IDF is a method that makes the change into the sparse matrix according to the frequecy of the words in the whole dataset. Although all the values that equal 0 in the sparse matrix will not be changed, other values in one review will be dealed with a weighted average based on its times of use in the whole dataset.\n",

    "# 5. Models Fitting and Prediction\n",
    "## 5.1 Linear regression\n",
    "To begin with, we naively choose variables of the top 1000 most frequent used words to fit a linear regression model. \n",
    "\n",
    "This figure below shows some words that has significant effect to a review. It is obvious that words like worse, horrible awful will definitly hurt a reviw.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What's more, we concern about the other factors like location, length of a review. By fitting linear regression, it turns to be statistical significant bewteen the stars and the length of a review that before cleaned, while not significant between stars and the city. Thus, the variable that the length of reviews is added into model.\n",
    "With this linear regression model, we predict the stars of test dataset, the mse turns out to be over 0.7 which is not good enough.\n",
    "<img src=\"words1.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.2 Multinomial logistic regression\n",
    "We try function 'multinom' in 'nnet' package based on variables selected by the previous linear regression model, to fit a multinomial logistic regression model since the response variable 'stars' is not binomial but has level more than 2. Firslt, we choose only 10 words with top 10 lowest p-values to be predictors, and then 20, 50, 100, 150, 180, 200... At last, we find that the mse of the cross validation by training dataset will not be smaller a lot when we keep number of variables over 180. Therefore, we finally keep 180 variables of words in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the multinomial logistic regression model is build, we do prediction for training dataset by using two different prediction type: 'class' and 'probs'. When applying 'class', it gives the exact outcomes to be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5. And 'probs' means that it returns the probability values to predict the result as 1 to 5. And then we do weighted average to obtain our final predictions of 'probs' type. It turns out to be that type of 'probs' is much more accurate than type of 'class' and the mse is quite low.\n",
    "<img src=\"words2.jpg\">\n",
    "Above are some top significant words (changed from baseline). For example, the first one 'gem' is of great effect on rating, which we can understand from its literal meaning. Howeverm the word like 'ist' seems to be unlikely to appear here, which may caused by problems in cleanning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we use this model to predict stars in training data. The result turns to be acceptable (having lowest rmse among all models we tried), which is exact our final model.\n",

    "## 5.3 XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we set the parameter 'nround' which means times of iteration to be 200 and the 'etc' which means the reduction of rmse in each iteration to be 0.01. Actually, rmse does not converge at last. Therefore, we add more and more the 'nrounds' and corresponding higher 'etc' and finally the rmse does not become lower any more in the last several iterations when 'nrounds' setted 500. \n",
